This bot uses Discord.js **v12.5.3** and started three years ago as a small joke among a small Discord server. It now has over 50 finished commands and more than 20 currently in the making, with much room for more in the forseeable future. This bot currently only supports commands in one particular server, as channel IDs are predefined to come from this one server, but that will soon be changed.

**Some features included:**
- various node packages, including mathjs, humanize-duration
- map and array collections
- async functions
- try/catch statements paired with console logging
- database managers using better-sqlite3
- mongoose api

**Just a few of the Discord specific features included:**
- role handling
- invite code tracking
- error catching in log channels
- message and reaction collectors
- currency systems
