Personal VALORANT-based Discord server bot that I began developing in 2019 to keep my friends entertained. Always in revision and having new features added while constantly adapting to the newest versions of **DiscordJS** and other libraries.

**Details:**
- This bot currently has 59 executable commands and can perform a handful of other event-based actions, including sending join/leave messages, logging and counting invites and assigning roles to users.
- This bot is utilizing a handful of **npm** packages for added code efficiency, including **Quick.db**, **Math.js**, **Humanize Duration** and others.
