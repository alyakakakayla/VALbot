Not the most professional project to showcase, but all the good (and the bad) within these files has become a major part of my software development journey. It's also made me a laughing stock for my friends, so it's a win-win for me.

This bot uses the glorious Discord.js **v12.5.3** library and was first created when I was 15 years old as an inside joke among a small group of friends in a small Discord server (please excuse the language!). It now has over 50 finished commands and features with more than 20 currently in the testing and debugging phase, with much room for more in the forseeable future. This bot currently only supports commands in one particular server, as all channel variables are initialized or declared with set IDs from this one server.

Some features included:
- various node packages including mathjs, humanize-duration
- map and array collections
- async functions
- try/catch statements paired with console logging
- database managers using better-sqlite3
- mongoose api

Just a few of the things this bot can do on Discord:
- role handling
- invite code tracking
- member tracking
- error catching sent to log channels
- message and reaction collectors
- currency systems
- nickname moderation
- multi-user interactives (like ship command)
- afk statuses
- type speed tracking

Certain commands and features like the member count tracker, invite tracker, and role handler may be changed in the future to support performance in other servers, but most of the commands on this bot will remain exclusive to its original server. Members of other servers who still want access to these particular commands will be redirected to this server.
